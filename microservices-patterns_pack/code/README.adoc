= FTGO example application

This is the example code for my book https://www.manning.com/books/microservice-patterns[Microservice patterns].

image::http://microservices.io/i/Microservices-Patterns-Cover.png[width=50%]

== Please note

* The code is still work in progress
* It primarily illustrates the technical aspects of the microservice architecture and so the business logic is minimal
* The documentation is sparse/non-existent and you will need to look in the book
* The application consists of many services and so requires a lot of memory. It runs well, for example, on a 16GB Macbook pro.
* The application's services and the infrastructure services, such as MySQL and Apache Kafka, are deployed using Docker containers using either Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

== Got questions

Please post a message to the https://forums.manning.com/forums/microservice-patterns[book's discussion forum] or create a github issue.
I'll do my best to help you.

== Application architecture

Not surprisingly, this application has a microservice architecture.
There are the following services:

* link:./ftgo-consumer-service[ftgo-consumer-service] - the `Consumer Service`
* link:./ftgo-restaurant-service[ftgo-restaurant-service] - the `Restaurant Service`
* link:./ftgo-order-service[ftgo-order-service] - the `Order Service`
* link:./ftgo-kitchen-service[ftgo-kitchen-service] - the `Kitchen Service`
* link:./ftgo-accounting-service[ftgo-accounting-service] - the `Accounting Service`
* link:./ftgo-order-history-service[ftgo-order-history-service] - a `Order History Service`, which is a CQRS view
* link:./ftgo-api-gateway[ftgo-api-gateway] - the API gateway

== Service design

Key points:

* A service consists of a single Gradle module.
For example, `ftgo-order-service` implements the `Order Service`
* A service is a Spring Boot application
* A service has a Swagger UI `http://.../swagger-ui.html`. See `open-swagger-uis.sh`
* A service typically consists of the following packages:
** domain - domain logic including aggregates
** messaging - messaging adapters
** web - Spring MVC controllers (HTTP adapters)
** main - the main application
* The services use the following other frameworks
** https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-core[`Eventuate Tram framework`] - implements transactional messaging
** https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-sagas[`Eventuate Tram Saga framework`] - implements sagas
** https://github.com/eventuate-clients/eventuate-client-java[`Eventuate Client framework`] - implements event sourcing

== Chapter by chapter

This section maps the chapters to the code.

=== Chapter 3 Inter-process communication in a microservice architecture

* The services have a REST API
* The services also communicate using the Apache Kafka message broker via the `Eventuate Tram` framework

=== Chapter 4 Managing transactions with sagas

The link:./ftgo-order-service[ftgo-order-service] uses sagas to maintain data consistency:

* link:./ftgo-order-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/orderservice/sagas/createorder/CreateOrderSaga.java[CreateOrderSaga]
* link:./ftgo-order-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/orderservice/sagas/cancelorder/CancelOrderSaga.java[CancelOrderSaga]
* link:./ftgo-order-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/orderservice/sagas/reviseorder/ReviseOrderSaga.java[ReviseOrderSaga]

The services that participate in these sagas define the following command handlers:

* `Accounting Service` link:./ftgo-accounting-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/accountingservice/messaging/AccountingServiceCommandHandler.java[AccountingServiceCommandHandler]
* `Consumer Service` link:./ftgo-consumer-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/consumerservice/domain/ConsumerServiceCommandHandlers.java[ConsumerServiceCommandHandlers]
* `Kitchen Service` link:./ftgo-kitchen-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/kitchenservice/messagehandlers/KitchenServiceCommandHandler.java[KitchenServiceCommandHandler]
* `Order Service` link:./ftgo-order-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/orderservice/service/OrderCommandHandlers.java[OrderCommandHandlers]



=== Chapter 5 Designing business logic in a microservice architecture

All the services' business logic is implemented using Domain-Driven design aggregates.

* `Accounting Service`
** link:./ftgo-accounting-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/accountingservice/domain/Account.java[`Account`] aggregate in the link:./ftgo-accounting-service[ftgo-accounting-service]
* `Consumer Service`
**  link:./ftgo-consumer-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/consumerservice/domain/Consumer.java[Consumer]
* `Order Service`
** link:./ftgo-order-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/orderservice/domain/Order.java[Order]
** link:./ftgo-order-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/orderservice/domain/Restaurant.java[Restaurant]
* `Kitchen Service`
**  link:./ftgo-kitchen-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/kitchenservice/domain/Restaurant.java[Restaurant]
** link:./ftgo-kitchen-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/kitchenservice/domain/Ticket.java[Ticket]
* `Restaurant Service`
** link:./ftgo-restaurant-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/restaurantservice/domain/Restaurant.java[Restaurant]


=== Chapter 6 Developing business logic with event sourcing

* The link:./ftgo-accounting-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/ftgo/accountingservice/domain/Account.java[`Account`] aggregate in the link:./ftgo-accounting-service[ftgo-accounting-service] is implemented using event sourcing

=== Chapter 7 Implementing queries in a microservice architecture

* link:./ftgo-order-history-service[ftgo-order-history-service] is an example of a CQRS view
* link:./ftgo-api-gateway[ftgo-api-gateway] uses API composition to implement the REST endpoint for retrieving the order history

=== Chapter 8 External API patterns

* link:./ftgo-api-gateway[ftgo-api-gateway] is the API gateway


== Building and running the application

=== Pre-requisites

* Java 8+
* Docker and Docker Compose
* Internet access so that Gradle and Docker can download dependencies and container images

=== Building

Temporary: Build the Spring Cloud Contracts using this command:

```
./build-contracts.sh
```

Build the services using this command:

```
./gradlew assemble
```

=== Setting environment variables


==== Quick way

A quick way to set the environment variables is to run the script `./set-env.sh`

==== Long way

To run the application you must set the `DOCKER_HOST_IP` environment variable to the IP address of where the Docker containers are running:

* Docker toolbox/Virtual machine - IP address of the virtual machine
* Docker for Windows/Mac/Linux - IP address of your laptop/desktop

Please do NOT set it to the (unresolvable) hostname of your machine, `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

You must also set the AWS environment variables.


=== Running the application

Run the application using this command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This can take a while.

=== Using the application

Use the services Swagger UIs to invoke the services.

* Create consumer - `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP?}:8081/swagger-ui.html`
* Create a restaurant - `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP?}:8084/swagger-ui.html`
* Create an order - `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP?}:8082/swagger-ui.html`
* View the order - `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP?}:8082/swagger-ui.html`
* View the order history -  `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP?}:8086/swagger-ui.html`

You can also access the application via the `API Gateway` at `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP?}:8087`.
However, currently it  doesn't have a Swagger UI so you will have to use `curl`, for example.

=== Stopping the application

Stop the application using this command:

```
docker-compose down -v
```

== Deploying the application on Kubernetes

You can find Kubernetes YAML files in the following directories: `deployment/kubernetes` and `*/src/deployment/kubernetes`.
There are also some helpful shell scripts.

=== Deploying services

You can run this command

```
./deployment/kubernetes/scripts/kubernetes-deploy-all.sh
```

=== Undeploying the services

You can run the script to undeploy the services:

```
./deployment/kubernetes/scripts/kubernetes-delete-all.sh
```

If you want to delete the persistent volumes for Apache Kafka, Zookeeper and MySQL please run the command:

```
./deployment/kubernetes/scripts/kubernetes-delete-volumes.sh
```
